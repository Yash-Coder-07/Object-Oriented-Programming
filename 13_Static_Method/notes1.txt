Static method vs non static method
= remember we can call static method with object reference or class name  e.g ClassName.staticMethod() or objReference.statiMethod()
= but non static method dependent on object so it can be called only  by object reference. e.g objReference.nonStaticMethod();

-------------------
We cannot access instance variable in static method directly we need to use referrence of object for it and
need to pass object as parameter
Example: here brand and price are instance variable
public static void show1(Mobile obj){
         System.out.println(obj.brand +":"+obj.price+":"+name);
    }

To call above method we can it like this
here Mobile is class and obj1 is actual object created.
Mobile.show1(obj1);

Remember one thing:
i)we can use static property, member inside non static block or method without object creation.
ii) But we cannot use non static property or method inside static block or method without object creation.
